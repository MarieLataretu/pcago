# User Interface

The user interface of PCAGO is divided in two sections

* The **sidebar** that lets you change settings
* The **results** that lets you view input tables and (intermediate) results

## Sidebar

The sidebar is separated into three sections:

* **Data** offers options to import and transform data such as read counts, gene annotations and sample conditions
* **PCA** lets you change PCA parameters and select the genes that should be used for PCA of samples
* **Plot** shows the settings of the currently viewed plot. This will be empty if no active plot is visible.

You can switch between those sections as you like. For example you can change the gene count that is used for the current plot.
