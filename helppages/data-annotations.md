Using annotations of the genes provided in the read count table allows you
to apply additional processing steps and to filter the genes used for the PCA.

## Providing annotations

Annotations can be uploaded in `Sidebar > Data > Annotation`.

Annotations can come in various forms and not every format covers all information
about the genes. As a solution to this problem, the annotation uploader allows
you to (up)load multiple annotation sources that are combined for further processing.

## Supported formats
