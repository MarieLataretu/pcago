# Read counts

To provide read counts, go to `Sidebar > Data > Import read counts` and choose
a sample data set or upload a file. You can find more information about the
upload widget in `Appendix > Upload widget` help section.



## Importing: File format

Read counts are provided in tabular form. Currently supported are CSV and TSV files (see `Appendix > File formats` for more information).

The read count table should have following form:

| ID    | Sample1                       | Sample2                       | Sample3 | ... |
|-------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|-------|-----|
| Gene1 | Read count of Gene1 in Sample1 | Read count of Gene1 in Sample2 | ...   | ... |
| Gene2 | Read count of Gene2 in Sample1 | ...                         | ...   | ... |
| Gene3 | ...                         | ...                         | ...   | ... |
| ...   | ...                         | ...                         | ...   | ... |
