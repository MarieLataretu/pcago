# Gene filtering

PCAGO allows you to filter the genes used a input for the PCA by different parameters.
You can find the filter in `Sidebar > PCA > Filter Genes`. By default all
available genes are selected.

You can add filters by clicking on the filter field and selecting the keywords.

**Tip:** You can search for keywords by typing in the field.

## Available filter categories

The filter categories are extracted from the gene annotation (see `Data > Annotations` help page).

* **Associated features** (Colored blue)
* **GO terms** (Colored green)
* **Scaffold** (Colored red)

## Filter settings

You can change the behavior of the filter field. By default it selects genes where
one of the listed categories match (**OR**). You can change this to genes that
 are in *all* selected categories (**AND**).

You can also *invert* the selection of the genes by ticking the "Invert" checkbox.
