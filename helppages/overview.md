# Overview

PCAGO is a tool to analyze RNA-Seq results with principal component analysis.
You can use it to ...

* check if cells with the same treatment/condition cluster together
* find out how including less and less variant genes affect this clustering
* find sets of genes that explain most of the data

PCAGO provides additional features that lets you do your tasks easier, like ...

* filtering genes by *associated features*, *GO terms* and more
* animating the clustering live when less and less variant genes are included
* importing annotations directly from online databases like Ensembl BioMart


## Quick usage

1. Go to the "Analyze" page
2. Upload your read counts in `Sidebar > Data > Readcounts` or choose a sample
3. Optionally (but advised) upload a gene annotation in `Sidebar > Data > Annotation`
4. Click on `Cell plot` to view the PCA results
