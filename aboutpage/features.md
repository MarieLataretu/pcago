      <h1>Import and process your data</h1>
      Upload your read count data or choose one of our example data sets. If your data is not normalized,
      you can apply read count normalization with DESeq2 or TPM directly within the app.
      You can view and export all generated data, as well as reports about the processing.

      <h1>Select the most interesting genes</h1>
      You can filter the genes by scaffold, biotype or GO terms. Just upload an annotation or use the integrated feature

      <h1>PCA & Clustering</h1>
      Create interactive PCA and hierarchical clustering plots of your cell and use the
      animation feature to analyze how adding more and more variant genes into the calculations
      changes the outcome. We also included highly flexible customization and coloring options
      directly within the web application.
