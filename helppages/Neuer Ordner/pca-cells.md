This category lets you view the transformed samples plot.

<label>Info</label> Theoretically, there will be as many principal component axes (PC1, PC2, ...) as genes. But common implementations
only calculate maximum the amount of samples. This means that if you have 5 samples, you would only be able to select PC1, PC2, ... PC5
even if you have 1000 genes.
